# html5-6sense-ad-custom

To run this file you will need the api key from you 6Sesne account. 

Then you need a loading icon.gif, a background image.png and a style css file. I have omitted these since they are not necessary for the purpose of this gist. 

## What does this code do?

This code allows someone to target different company names per ip address using 6Sense, and display different text associated with the company name. This improves the level of personalization you can do using html5 ads with 6sense.
